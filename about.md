# About

This documentation project is **not** meant to be an
exhaustive look at coding with kids.

Rather it was used as the basis
for a video course about learning
how to use [Read The Docs](http://readthedocs.org).

`Hopefully` you take this in an spirit that--
in which it was written and pardon any
exclusion or inaccuracies.

Comments are mine, not any else's. Etc.
